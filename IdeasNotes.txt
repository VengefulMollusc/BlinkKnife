ISSUES
needs to be a limit on how quickly you can turn and keep momentum. 
currently you can turn almost on a dime and keep full speed if you're careful.
maybe angle-per-second limit?

need to check midair hover behaviour with various speeds.

midair movement/turning doesn't feel right. I know knife provides a fix to most air movement
issues but it seems too hard to land accurately, even at low speed.

low-mid-distance regular warp feedback needs to be ramped up. FOV? more distortion?

still need to work on knife warp prediction: cast player-sized collider ahead to 
see if can warp. otherwise 'fizzle' warp and return knife

parenting player(or knife or anything really) to objects gets really screwy with parent scale.
possible alternative is to just store the object to be 'parented' and manually copy/update from its
position/rotation?


Puzzles:
	use gravity rotation and direction to move objects

giant clock:
	walk around particular cylinder to wind clock forward/back
	clock time controls progression of scenery?
	collapsing castle?

Uru time machine level
	Skybox exists as physical entity - world contained in artificial sphere
	Can eventually reach by disabling machine that resets player on travelling too far

Jump pads?
	to play with warping keeping momentum


Other Character ideas?
wall boost jump? - directional? just vertical?
wall-run
momentum glide?
sniper - warp hang from surface?
hang in air and aim
grapple
flatten to 2d? on surface or in 3d space (cut things by running through them?)
pass through walls/ghost
