ISSUES
needs to be a limit on how quickly you can turn and keep momentum. 
currently you can turn almost on a dime and keep full speed if you're careful.
maybe angle-per-second limit?

need to check midair hover behaviour with various speeds.

midair movement/turning doesn't feel right. I know knife provides a fix to most air movement
issues but it seems too hard to land accurately, even at low speed.

still need to work on knife warp prediction: working well at the moment but need to have a deep look for bugs.
also need to make sure behaviour is right when knife spends extended period of time travelling through 
small space.
There is also a bug with warping to a knife that's stuck in a moving object. lastUsablePos before collision
is used rather than the collision point which is better. Probably fixed if I can change the collision normal 
warp offset to work relative to the angle (eg: whatever the right distance is to the bounds of the player collider
rather than a fixed value)
	Detail:
		Add trigger collider to knife object 
			(probably spherical radius 1? encompass entire player collider?
			capsule would probably work better but would need to make sure rotation
			always correct to gravity. too wide/large and this will be triggering
			too often while knife moves next to a wall/floor etc)
		if trigger not colliding, location guaranteed 100% safe.
			match warplookahead collider to knife exactly.
		if trigger colliding, location may not be ok
			use (current) distance-limited MoveTowards code to step in direction of knife
			when warplookahead colliding again, just match knife position
	ALSO: need to make sure bounceknife works properly as knife rapidly changes direction


MINOR/VISUAL
low-mid-distance regular warp feedback needs to be ramped up. FOV? more distortion?

Need solution to black-out camera when transition camera is inside mesh.
possibly just add a small spherical trigger collider to the transition camera and disable the camera or 
add some sort of effect/overlay when trigger is inside mesh.



Puzzles:
	use gravity rotation and direction to move objects

giant clock:
	walk around particular cylinder to wind clock forward/back
	clock time controls progression of scenery?
	collapsing castle?

Uru time machine level
	Skybox exists as physical entity - world contained in artificial sphere
	Can eventually reach by disabling machine that resets player on travelling too far

Jump pads?
	to play with warping keeping momentum


Other Character ideas?
wall boost jump? - directional? just vertical?
wall-run
momentum glide?
sniper - warp hang from surface?
hang in air and aim
grapple
flatten to 2d? on surface or in 3d space (cut things by running through them?)
pass through walls/ghost
