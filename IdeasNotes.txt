ISSUES
needs to be a limit on how quickly you can turn and keep momentum. 
currently you can turn almost on a dime and keep full speed if you're careful.
maybe angle-per-second limit?

need to check midair hover behaviour with various speeds.

midair movement/turning doesn't feel right. I know knife provides a fix to most air movement
issues but it seems too hard to land accurately, even at low speed.

still need to work on knife warp prediction: working well at the moment but need to have a deep look for bugs.
also need to make sure behaviour is right when knife spends extended period of time travelling through 
small space.
	ALSO: need to make sure bounceknife works properly as knife rapidly changes direction


MINOR/VISUAL
low-mid-distance regular warp feedback needs to be ramped up. FOV? more distortion?

Need solution to black-out camera when transition camera is inside mesh.
possibly just add a small spherical trigger collider to the transition camera and disable the camera or 
add some sort of effect/overlay when trigger is inside mesh.



Puzzles:
	use gravity rotation and direction to move objects

giant clock:
	walk around particular cylinder to wind clock forward/back
	clock time controls progression of scenery?
	collapsing castle?

Uru time machine level
	Skybox exists as physical entity - world contained in artificial sphere
	Can eventually reach by disabling machine that resets player on travelling too far

Jump pads?
	to play with warping keeping momentum


Other Character ideas?
wall boost jump? - directional? just vertical?
wall-run
momentum glide?
sniper - warp hang from surface?
hang in air and aim
grapple
flatten to 2d? on surface or in 3d space (cut things by running through them?)
pass through walls/ghost
