INSTALLATION
-------------

I. IMPORT SUIMONO BASE FILES INTO YOUR PROJECT

Go to: "Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package..." in the Unity Menu. Then select the
"Suimono_watersystem_v2.x.unitypackage" file.  This will open an import dialog box.
Click the import button and all the Suimono files will be imported into your project list.

A Note about Demo Content... The Suimono installer file contains a large number of files for the advanced demo scene.  If you don’t need this scene in your project, you can disable importing the demo content by unchecking the SUIMONO - WATER SYSTEM 2/_DEMO folder in the import dialog window before importing.


II. ADD THE SUIMONO PREFABS TO YOUR SCENE

1) Drag the SUIMONO_Module prefab (located in the "/PREFABS" folder) into your scene.
2) Drag the SUIMONO_Surface prefab (located in the "/PREFABS" folder) into your scene.
3) Add your main scene camera to the 'scene camera object' slot on the module.
4) (NEW!) Add your main scene directional light to the 'scene light object' slot on the module.
5) (NEW!) Go to your scene camera object and (if necessary) add the Underwater component by going to Component-->Image Effects-->Suimono-->UnderwaterFX


That's it for the basic installation!  You can now position “SUIMONO_Surface” anywhere in your scene that you like, and even rename the “Suimono_Surface” object to anything you wish. This object can also be scaled to fit your scene, but please see the scale note below!
More in depth installation and setup instructions, as well as a helpful FAQ can be found in the full documentation PDF, available here: http://tanukidigital.com/suimono/documentation

A NOTE ABOUT UPGRADES:
Since this is a major update it's recommended to delete your current Suimono scene objects, the suimono effect on your camera, and then completely delete the Suimono folder in the Project list, and delete any suimono specific game layers before installing this update.



----------------------------
CUSTOMIZATION NOTES
----------------------------
DEFINING YOUR SCENE CAMERA:
Suimono tracks a scene camera in order to determine when to initiate the underwater switch. By default Suimono will track the scene camera object that has it’s object tag set to “MainCamera”. However, you can customize which camera Suimono tracks (under the module configuration tab) by changing the 'Camera Mode' to 'Manual Select Camera' and then adding your camera to the 'Scene Camera Object'”' attribute before running your scene.  If you're game is designed around a 3rd person controller, you'll want to designate your character object as the "Scene Track Object"... otherwise for most first-person games, the scene track object would be the same as the scene camera object.  If the scene track object is left vacant it Suimono will automatically set it to the scene camera object specified above.

-----------------------------
WHAT'S NEW:
(new since 2.1.1 preview)
- Improved default performance settings.
- Added new 'Camera Mode' setting which switches between auto select and manual camera designation.
- Added slots to enable/disable underwater and above-water sounds from module UI.
- Added attribute to enable/disable advanced caustic effects (comes with performance cost when enabled).
- Added reflection blur function.
- Added underwater blur function.
- Added underwater darkening setting which shifts the brightness underwater as you get deeper.
- Added Gaia GX compatibility.

(new since 2.1.0a)
- Completely rewritten water shader and wave effects.
- Water surface waves can now be modulated based on Beaufort wave scale (0-12), from still to calm to stormy.
- New Underwater Effect, now contained in an Image Effect component that get's added to camera.
- Improved Edge Blending effects.
- New Caustic system with better performance and more realistic rendering.
- ReWritten Preset system. Each preset is now contained within it's own file, which can be backed up (and shared!) as needed.
- New Shoreline system.  Setting up where you want shoreline waves and foam to be generated is now customizable with the new 'ShorelineObject' prefab.
- New Integrated normals displacement/refraction effects, most notably on the ripple effect.
- Improved foam rendering.  Edge foam now blends properly with shoreline and other objects and renders into the distance.

- Graphics auto-switching.  Dx9 and Dx11 versions are now determined automatically and should switch based on the computer and Unity settings.
- Rendering Parity between Forward/Deferred/Legacy Deferred.

CHANGES:
- Adjusted water surface wave and reflection calculations.

- Screen drop and fade effects now moved to camera effect.
- Improved height-wave foam rendering.

BUG FIXES:
